Question 1: No. The change inside increment_int_a can't change the variable a after the function call. 

Question 2: Yes. The change inside increment_int_b changes the variable a after the function call

Question 3: Reason for the unchange of value of a: the reason is that the parameter "someval" and "a" are different and they are not connected to each other. In addition, we passed the value, the result will not changed. Therefore, when we defined the function increment_int_a and called a. We just passed the value of a, and someval +=1 doesn;t affect the value of a. The value of a we will get will be 32.

Question 3: Reason for the change of value b becasue it is passed by reference . Therefore, when we call increment_int_b and put value of b. As a result, the value of b is added to 1 and it showed b=33.
